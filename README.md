Ramps-1.4.2
===========

forked from ultimachine/Ramps 1.4 and GermanRepRap/Ramps-1.4.2

RAMPS 1.4.3 Change log

* All necessary parts 12/24V compatible

* Better MOSFETs
 * Lower RDSon, less heat

RAMPS 1.4.2 Change log

* Standard blade fuses instead of thermal fuses increasing the heat resilience.
 	
* Current carrying improved by increasing the thickness of the cooper at the PCB from 35 to 70 micro meters.

* Suppression caps added to each end-stop to avoid spurious signals.

* Added an additional connector to XY, E1 and E2 to connect a second stepper motor.

* Connector for external reset added.

* Labeled D8, D9,D10 with Heatbed, Extrude 1, Fan and Extruder 2.
